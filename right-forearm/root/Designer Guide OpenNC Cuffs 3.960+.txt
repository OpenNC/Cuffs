This is just an updated version of the OpenCollar cuffs 1.335+ guide.

This is a help for people who want to use the OpenNC Cuffs script set to create  their own cuffs.

1) Different parts of the cuffs:
-----------------------------------------

Main cuff (rlac):
There are 3 different functional prims needed for the main cuff (as well as for the slaves, but with a different set of scripts in the root prim there):
Root prim (should be an invisible prim in the mid of the cuff):
The root prim should be invisible in the mid of the cuff. It contains all command scripts (script set 1) as well as the animations, textures and sounds needed. For easier configuration this prim also contains 2 notecards, in which you can set the animations and the chains for the arm and leg modules. The following format is used in the "Arm Cuffs" and "Leg Cuffs" notecards:
Label|Animation|point1=point2~point3=point4~etc.
Label is the label to show on the menu.
Animation is the name of the animation to play, or *none* for no animation, if only chains are to be shown.
And the final part is a tilde separated list of points to connect.  They tell the first point to send a lockguard command to the second point telling it to connect to itself.
You need to include as well the readme and the license.
Note: the "defaultsettings" notecards can contain some default settings for the cuffs. It is best to use the "Settings Dump" to set the notecard.

OpenNC Cuff chain points:
The prim need to be named like the chain point (see list above for currently used chain points). Example: llac. The prim contains a scripts for creating the chains and well as a lockguard config card. The config card contains the standard settings for the cuffs and can contain as well additional IDs. Example: ID occuffs.

LockGuard/LockMeister points for devices to attach chains to:
OpenCollar cuffs use an invisible prim place over a ring to attach the chains from devices to. This allows the chains from the cuffs to be active, while the sub is on a device. The prim needs to be named like the LockMeister point (Example: lcuff) , the Lock Guard point is set in the config note card: (Example: ID leftwrist). So you need to edit the notecard properly for each cuff.

Slave cuffs (llac, ruac, luac, rllc, lllc, rulc, lulc, ocbelt):
There are 3 different functional prims needed for the slave cuffs as well as for the belt:
Root prim (should be an invisible prim in the mid of the cuff):
Needs to contain the scripts set 2. To keep the colors in sync to the main cuff, the descriptions should use identical naming schemes.

OpenNC Cuff chain points and LockGuard/LockMeister points for devices to attach chains to:
See Main cuff.

Collar (occollar):
The collar can contain the cuff addon, but this is not essential needed. If you want to add more OC Chain points or LM/LG chain points, you need to add the listern as well and can add additional prims for chaining like in the main/slave cuffs.

2) Walkthrough of creating a cuff
--------------------------------------------

Walkthrough for those wanting to use the OpenNC scripts in their own prim designs.
 
 A) - CREATE A ROOT PRIM FOR THE MAIN
- This should be an invisible Sphere in the mid of the cuff and is also required by the coloring and texturing scripts. To make it invisible apply a fully transparent texture, such as the one provided within the OpenNC or OpenCollar. 


 B) - NAME THE ELEMENTS OF THE CUFF
•    The color and texture changing scripts can apply color or texture to a group of prims at once. To enable this feature, give all matching elements in your cuff the same Description. For example, you could put the word "Jewels" in the description of all prims in your cuff which look like jewels. Then their colors could be set all together by the color script. The texture scripts behave similarly. IMPORTANT: The slave cuffs need to use the same naming convention. The color and texture scripts will only look for the Group names in the main cuff (right forearm. All color and texture changes from the script will be send on a per AV personalized chat channel to the slave cuffs, which than change colors. The main difference between the main cuff and the sub cuff is the set of scripts in the root prim. The right forarm cuff is the “brain” of the cuff set.
    
NOTES 
   1.    The root prim. The coloring and texturing scripts will not set color or texture for the root prim. This is another reason to have the root prim be an invisible ball in the mid of the main cuff and as well the subcuffs. 
   2.    Disabling the texture and color features. If you wish to prevent a group of prims from being colored, or textured, you can add "~nocolor ", or "~notexture" to the description as well. (It is a good idea to look how the single prims of the OpenCuffs are named, in Object Name and Description.) In our "Jewels" example, you would probably want to have the description be "Jewels~notexture", so that the texture script will leave your jewel textures alone, but the color script will still be able to tint the jewel prims. 
   3.    OC Chain prims. The default OpenNC cuffs have 3 chain points for the internal chain system of the cuffs. Those chain points can be visible parts of the cuff or invisible spheres. Each requires a script and a notecard (script set 4, see below), but to save lag the main listener is in the root prim of the cuffs. The prim needs to be named like the OC Chain point. For the right forearm the cuff point at the back would be called “rlac” (right lower arm cuff), the outer one gets the name “orlac” (outer right lower arm cuff), the inner one “irlac” (inner right lower arm cuff). The cuff for the left upper leg would get OC chain poins as follows: the cuff point at the back would be called “lulc” (left upper leg cuff), the outer one gets the name “olulc” (outer left upper leg cuff), the inner one “ilulc” (inner left upper leg cuff).
   4.    LockGuard/LockMeister chain prim. Those chain points can be visible parts of the cuff or invisible spheres. Usually every cuff part has only 1 of those, exceptions are the collar and the belt, which can have more. See the LockMeister or LockGuard API descriptions for more info. Each requires a script and a notecard (script set 5, see below), but to save lag the main listener is in the root prim of the cuffs. The prim needs to be named like the LockMeister Chain point. The ID for the LockGuard chain point is set in the notecard, as a prim can have multiple LockGuard ID. For the right forarm cuff the LockMeister ID is “rcuff”, so the prim needs to be named “rcuff”. For LockGuard this cuff usually gets 3 IDs: “ID rightwrist” for the right forarm, “ID wrists” so a device can grab both forearm cuffs with one command, and “ID allfour” so the wrist and ankle cuffs can be grabbed with one command. The ID need to be entered in the notecard as separate lines.

Examples: 
   1.    Description: spike — this groups these prims together and they can be recolored/textured 
   2.    Description: heart~notexture — lets say you have one or 3 prims that form a heart on your cuffs. Putting this description in each of these prims will group them (if only one it is a one member group but without the description it is not recognized as "element" of your color in the scripts) So now the heart color can be changed but the texture cannot!! 
   3.    Description: padlock~nocolor~ here all padlock prims get grouped and they can later be changed by the cuffs user only at their texture. 
The "~" symbols a new tag for this prim, remember ALL prims that belong to one kind of element of your cuffs need this. Most likely I can imagine to use for things like spikes a description as: spike~notexture —- so they can be colored but the texture you chose within reason cannot be changed 


 C) - COPY THE CONTENTS
Main cuff:
Copy the scripts, anims, notecards, objects, and textures (script set 1, see below) included in the contents of the basic right forearm OpenNC Cuff -- from here on known as the OpenNC Cuff main cuff guts -- into the root prim of your right forearm cuff (ie, the invisible ball in the middle). 
Copy the script set 4 to all OC chain point sub prims and the script set 5 to all LM/LG chain point sub prims.

Slave cuffs and belt:
Copy the scripts (script set 2, see below) included in the contents of the basic left forearm OpenCuff -- from here on known as the OpenNC Cuff slave cuff guts -- into the root prim of your slave cuff (ie, the invisible ball in the middle of thje left forarm cuff or of the belt).
Copy the script set 4 to all OC chain point sub prims and the script set 5 to all LM/LG chain point sub prims.

Collar:
If you want to fdeliver a collar with your cuff set, please make sure it is buld liked described here: http://code.google.com/p/opencollar/wiki/DesignerInstructions.
Add the cuffs addon from script set 3 and if you want to use additonla OpenCuff and/or LM/LG chain points as well the _slave script from script set 3.
Copy the script set 4 to all OC chain point sub prims and the script set 5 to all LM/LG chain point sub prims you added to the collar.
Attention: The collar itself already supports the LockMeister chain point “collar” itself, so please do NOT add a chain point for this ID.


 D) - RECORD THE SCRIPT VERSION AND DATABASE PREFIX
Several OpenCollar/OpenNC features depend on the object's Description being properly formatted. It should look something like this: 
SteelCuffs~stc_ 
As you can see, the description is divided into 3 parts, separated by a tilde ("~") character. The first part (SteelCuffs, in this example) is the product's name. It can be anything you want. 
The Second part ("stc _") is the database prefix. OpenNC Cuffs use an internal database to save the settings. 
In the Description field of the root prim, change "stc_" to something that is likely to be unique. A good rule is to use your initials, plus the product initials. So if Cleo Collins made "Super Fancy Cuffs", she might put "ccfc_" as the prefix. 


 E) - RESET THE SCRIPTS
Select your collar object using the Edit tools and click "Tools->Reset Scripts in Selection" in the SL menu. 


 F) - CHECK PERMISSIONS
Make sure you have left all of the OpenCollar guts full perms. You can apply whatever permissions you want to the prims containing the OpenCollar system, but the scripts, notecards, textures, animations, etc, must always remain full perms. 

G) - DELIVERING TO CUSTOMERS
If your cuff set does not have a own collar version, you should deliver the pluging to your customers as well, as it syncronizes the cuffs and the collar.  The plugin has a version check build in so it complaisn if
- the version o the collar is too old
- there is more than one plugin, because the user had already a cuff plugin in the collar
To make sure these check do not get performed when rezzing the distributor box, when  the script is in your delivery box, please start the desctription of you box with "Delivery Box".

Thanks go out to Anne Karas (inital communications and poses system), Pol McLaglen (starting the project and initial cuff design), Jesrad Seraph (additional poses), Winter Seale (some script improvements and bug fixings), Sandra Merilouto (testing) and Garvin Twine (testing and advise). Don’t forget Athaliah Opus and Nandana Singh, who started that OC madness and the mayn scripter involved in the OC project, on which this cuffs scripts are based on. You rock!

Thanks as well for all who contributed and are not mentioned here. We hope, you like the cuffs and find this documentation useful.

The cuffs use the LockMeister protocol by Kyrah Abattoir, which is under GPL3. Find more infos here: http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Protocol/LockMeister_System.
The cuffs use the  LockGuard V2 System Protocol by Lillani Lowell.
